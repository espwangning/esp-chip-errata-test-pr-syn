Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

In RMII working mode, the Ethernet MAC and PHY require a common 50 MHz reference clock (i.e., the RMII clock). If Wi-Fi and Ethernet are used simultaneously, the RMII clock cannot be generated by the internal APLL clock, as it would result in clock instability.

Workarounds
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. If you want to use the internal APLL to generate the reference clock, you need to disable Wi-Fi.
#. If you want to use both Ethernet and Wi-Fi simultaneously, you need to use an external PHY or external clock source to provide the reference clock.

Solution
^^^^^^^^
